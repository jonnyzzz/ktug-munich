# Kotlin User Group Munich


Welcome to the meetup management GitHub repository. We will try using that repository to manage everything
for the meetup using GitHub and Pull Requests. 

**It is unclear right now if it will be possible**

Find everything on the [KTUG Munich](https://www.meetup.com/Kotlin-User-Group-Munich/) page in meetups.com
